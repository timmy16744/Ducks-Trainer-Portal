**Client Preview Modal - COMPLETED**

**Summary of Changes:**
- **Frontend:**
    - Modified `TrainerDashboard.js` to use a modal for client dashboard previews instead of opening a new browser tab.
    - Introduced new state variables (`showClientModal`, `clientToViewId`) in `TrainerDashboard.js` to control the visibility and content of the client preview modal.
    - Created a new component `ClientViewModal.js` which renders the `ClientDashboard` inside an iframe within a React-Bootstrap modal.
    - Updated the client link in `TrainerDashboard.js` to trigger the modal instead of navigating to a new page.

**Key Decisions Made:**
- Implemented a modal-based preview to provide a more integrated and seamless user experience for trainers, allowing them to quickly view client dashboards without disrupting their workflow.
- Used an iframe within the modal to load the client dashboard, ensuring that the client-side routing and PWA functionality remain isolated and accurate.
